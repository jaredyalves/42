# 42

This repository contains a collection of projects I completed while studying at 42's Porto campus.

## Projects

I'm in the process of consolidating my projects into this single repository. Previously, each project had its own separate repository, but I'm now migrating them to this central location.

#### Piscine

The `piscine` is an intensive, month-long introduction to the 42 curriculum, designed to immerse students in the basics of programming and software development.

#### Cursus

The `cursus` is the core curriculum of 42, a comprehensive program that covers a wide range of topics in computer science and software development.
